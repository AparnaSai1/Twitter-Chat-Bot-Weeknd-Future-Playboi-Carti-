# TwitterChatBot (Weeknd,Future,Playboi-Carti)
Created Twitter Chat Bot using Python to reply with a collection of songs to tweets that contain the words "Weeknd" and "song" in them. You can test this code yourself by creating a Twitter API developer account, accessing your own configuration keys, replacing them in the code, and running using a terminal (I used VS Code). 
^ Created during a Girls Who Code workshop
